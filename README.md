# K-means-Clustering-From-Scratch-Python

In this project, we'll build a k-means clustering algorithm from scratch. Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that can find patterns in your data. K-means is one of the most popular forms of clustering.

We'll create our algorithm using python and pandas. We'll then compare it to the reference implementation from scikit-learn.

Project Steps

1. Write out pseudocode for the algorithm
2. Code the k-means algorithm
3. Plot the clusters from the algorithm
4. Compare performance to the scikit-learn algorithm
5. K-means overview
6. K-means is an unsupervised machine learning technique that allow us to cluster data points. This enables us to find patterns in the data that can help us analyze it more effectively. K-means is an iterative algorithm, which means that it will converge to the optimal clustering over time.
